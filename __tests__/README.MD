# Following steps to create test cases

# First, create a new folder( folder name must be unique and same as the component or page and first letter must be capital e.g. Home)

# inside folder, create a new file( file name must have '.test' before the extension name and extension name must be '.js' or '.tsx' e.g. sample.test.js or sample.test.tsx)

# then go to terminal(Click on the "View" option in the menu bar at the top of the window, Select "Terminal" from the dropdown list, or press (Windows/Linux: Ctrl + `(backtick) or Mac: Cmd +` (backtick)) on your keyboard) execute command 'npm run test' to run the tests

# If you want to run the test only in one file, run command 'npm run test <filename>'

# If you want to run the test all files in the same folder, run command 'npm run test ./foldername'

# If you want to run the test on the child folder, run command 'npm run test ./foldername/childFolder'

# You can also check the example inside the `__tests__` folder for your references
